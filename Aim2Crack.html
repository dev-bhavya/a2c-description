         <h2>Description about the topic</h2>
         <p>A mixture, as the name suggests is mixing two or more things together.</p>
         <p><h4>Simple Mixture</h4> When two different ingredients are mixed together, it is known as a simple mixture.</p>
         <p><h4>Compound Mixture</h4> When two or more simple mixtures are mixed together to form another mixture, it is known as a compound mixture. The word ‘Alligation’ literally means ‘linking’. Alligation is the rule which enables us to
            find the ratio in which two or more elements are mixed together and at what price they are sold to earn profit or face loss. To solve mixture and alligation questions, it must be known that alligation is used to find the mean value of a
            mixture when the ratio and amount of ingredients mixed are different and also to find the proportion in which the elements are mixed.</p>
         <p><h4>Mean Price</h4> The cost of a unit quantity of the mixture is called mean price.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="formulas">
         <h2>General Formulas Used</h2>
         <p>Set of formulas which makes the question solving process easier and time- saving are:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>(Quantity of Cheaper)/(Quantity of Dearer) = <br>
               (Price of Dearer – Mean Price)/(Mean Price-Price of Cheaper)
            </li>
            <li>We present as under:</li>
            <li>Suppose a container contains x of liquid from which y units are taken out and replaced by water.<br>
               After n operations, the quantity of pure liquid is : [x(1-y/x)^n] units
            </li>
            <li>If the average of the measured quantity was <br>
               A1 for group 1 containing n1 elements <br>
               A1 for group 2 containing n2 elements <br>
               A1 for group 3 containing n3 elements <br>
               A1 for group k containing nk elements <br>
               We say that the weighted average, Aw is given by <br>
               <div class="equation">Aw = (n1A1 + n2A2 + n3A3 + …… + nkAk) / (n1 + n2 + n3 + …… +nk)</div>
               That is, the weighted average
               <div class="equation">= sum total of all groups/Total number of elements in all groups together</div>
            </li>
         </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="example-ques">
         <h4>Example:</h4>
         <p>
            In the case of the situation where just two groups are being mixed, we can write this as:
         </p>
         <p class="equation-eg">Aw = (n1A1 + n2A2)/(n1 + n2)</p>
         <p>Rewriting this equation we get:</p>
         <p class="equation-eg">(n1 + n2)Aw = n1A1 + n2A2</p>
         <p class="equation-eg">n1(Aw - A1) = n2(A2 - Aw)</p>
         <p>Or,</p>
         <p class="equation-eg">n1/n2 = (A2 - Aw)/(Aw - A1) ➡ (This is alligation equation)</p>
